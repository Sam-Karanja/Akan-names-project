            <h1>Birthday Calculator</h1>
        <p>
          Most people do know when their birthdays are, but some might not know
          what day of the week they were born. Luckily for us, there are ways to
          calculate the day of the week from a specific date. This is an
          application that allows a user to input their date of birth,
          calculates the day of the week they were born and born based on their
          gender and outputs their Akan name.
        </p>

        <p>
          Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana,
          children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds
          to the day in the week they were born.
        </p>

              your details in the form below.
